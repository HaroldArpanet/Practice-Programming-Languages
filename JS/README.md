-------------
You can run all the code in the console section of your browser.
-------------

-------------
example1.js --> In this exercise, two numbers are taken from the user and calculations can be performed according to the user's choice.
Be careful to challenge the prohibition against using the else if JavaScript command.
-------------

-------------
example2.js --> In this exercise, we did the same as Exercise 1, but the ban on using the else if JavaScript command was removed.
-------------

-------------
example3.js --> In this exercise, we did the same as exercises 1 and 2, but the switch command was used.
-------------

-------------
example4.js --> In this exercise, we used the while to add the numbers 1 to 100 and get the famous result of 5050.
-------------

-------------
example5.js --> In these exercises, we drew geometric shapes using the while command and nested loops.
-------------

-------------
example6.js --> In these exercises, we drew geometric shapes using the for command and nested loops.
-------------

-------------
example7.js --> In this exercise, we wrote code using JavaScript that the user considers a number between 1 and 1000 and the computer with the help of the user to guess this number.
-------------

-------------
example8.js --> In this exercise, which is the complete opposite of Exercise 7, the computer considers a number between 1 and 1000, and the user must guess it.
-------------

-------------
example9.js --> In this exercise, we take the user's first and last name and ask the user to separate the two by underline and display the user's first and last name separately. (Split is used in this exercise)
-------------

-------------
example10.js --> In this exercise, we did the same thing we did in Exercise 9 again, but we did not use split and tried to be creative.
-------------

-------------
example11.js --> In this exercise again, we did the same thing we did in Exercises 9 and 10, but in a different way.
